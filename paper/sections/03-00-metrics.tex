\section{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}

This section defines five quantitative metrics for evaluating sequential monochromatic color
palettes.
Three metrics assess the internal behavior of individual CIELAB components:
lightness linearity, chroma smoothness, and hue stability, capturing how each perceptual
dimension evolves along a color ramp.
A fourth metric evaluates perceptual spacing uniformity using the CIEDE2000 color difference,
quantifying the consistency of stepwise transitions.
The final metric measures contrast efficiency by analyzing the accessibility span required to
satisfy the WCAG 4.5{:}1 contrast ratio.
Together, these five metrics characterize both the perceptual structure and accessibility
performance of a color palette.
